where I semi-accidentally ended up challenging myself
to make as many drawings as I can without ever repeating a style.
I've compiled my "attacks" and "defenses" on this page.
Big thanks to everyone involved for making such lovely art
and allowing me to post it!</p>

    <p>One defense is still pending permission from the creator.
I'll update the page when they reply.</p>

<p>For the uninitiated, Art Fight is a game taking place over the month of July
where artists draw (or sculpt, or animate, or crochet, or ...) each other's characters.
Sending somebody an artwork is referred to as an "attack",
which generates points for your team,
and receiving an artwork is called a "defense".
So the "attacks" here are my drawings of other people's characters,
and "defenses" are others' drawings of my characters.
If you have an Art Fight account, you can also browse these on <a href="https://artfight.net/~Molentum">my profile</a>.</p>
