The dryads, Ivu amongst them, are caretakers of the forest

![Four different clothing designs for one feminine figure with birch bark for skin.
One is naked. The second wears a long green dress decorated with orange flame-like sigils.
The third wears an apron on top of an orange dress with red decorative drapery.
The fourth wears an apron with one shoulder strap undone on top of a collared t-shirt,
a frilly red skirt, and a straw hat.](ivu_alts.jpg)
