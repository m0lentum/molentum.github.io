I did Inktober every other day again this year,
incorporating colored inks for the first time
to varying levels of success.
I used the travel-themed prompts to explore [Miriel](../miriel/)'s adventures
and develop the world she lives in.

## 02. Discover
![Miriel sitting on grassy ground, lifting up a small rock with her hand.
In the space under the rock is a tiny frog looking up at her.](discover.jpg)

## 04. Exotic
![A mountain range littered with windmills.
Miriel stands in the foreground wearing a cloak and a backpack,
looking up at the nearest windmill.](exotic.jpg)
The mountain dwarves' massive wind farms are certainly an exotic sight
for the forest elves whose energy needs are met by firewood and a few solar panels.

## 06. Trek
![A snowy forest viewed from up high in the trees.
Boot tracks are seen on the ground,
leading up to someone wearing a hooded green coat and a backpack.](trek.jpg)

## 08. Hike
![Miriel in light hiking gear - a sleeveless tunic, linen pants, and leather boots -
walking in a forest alongside a stream. There's a little school of fish in the water.](hike.jpg)

## 10. Nomadic
![A campsite in a forest. There are tents, hammocks, and solar panels scattered throughout the scene.](nomadic.jpg)
The forest elves spend their summers hunting and foraging in small groups,
living in lightweight camps, converging back to permanent settlements for the winter.

## 12. Remote
![Colored ink drawing of Miriel speaking into a walkie-talkie.
She's standing in a forest and looking at something ahead of her.](remote.jpg)
The elves may live a simple life, but that doesn't mean they reject technology.
A portable radio, for instance, is very handy out in the wild.

A failed color experiment where I made things too dark at first
and tried my best to pull it back by glazing white ink on top.
In hindsight a better solution would have been to make the darkest parts even darker.

## 14. Roam
![Ink drawing using colored lines.
Miriel is standing in a meadow, bending down slightly to pick a flower.
She has a wreath of flowers in her hair.](roam.jpg)

## 16. Grungy
![Colored ink painting of a rusted ship on a beach. Miriel stands in the foreground looking up at it.](grungy.jpg)

## 18. Drive
![Miriel hammering a tent stake into the ground somewhere in a forest.](drive.jpg)

## 20. Uncharted
![Colored ink painting of a landscape with a lake, an island, and long stretches of forest all around.
Miriel is looking down on the scene from a tree, shielding her eyes from the sun with her hand.](uncharted.jpg)

## 22. Camp
![Miriel sitting on a log, roasting a fish on a fire.
She's let her hair down from its usual braid and set up a hammock in the background.](camp.jpg)

## 24. Expedition
![Miriel in a room strewn with baskets and buckets of vegetables, berries, and fruits.
She's holding a tomato in her hand.](expedition.jpg)
Trading for produce at a nearby human settlement's community pantry.

## 26. Camera
![Miriel lying down on her stomach with a camera, taking a picture of a small bird standing on the ground.](camera.jpg)

## 28. Jumbo
![A huge mermaid statue partially in water.
Under the surface a mermaid is seen chiseling at the statue's tail.
The statue is shaded with gray ink.](jumbo.jpg)
After the merfolk realized how much easier it was to get food
by farming and fishing rather than luring sailors to their deaths,
they've been mostly preoccupied with art and architecture.

## 30. Violin
![Two elves, one with a moustache and a kilt playing the violin
and one with hair over their face and a long dress playing a scandinavian-style drum.
In the background there are rows of lanterns on strings and people standing around in fancy clothes.](violin.jpg)
The annual harvest festival marks the elves' return
to their winter dwellings.
