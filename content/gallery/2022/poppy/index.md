gothic-style stained glass window in an otherwise dark room. The bottom half of
the window depicts red poppy flowers, the rest is a circular decorative design.
In front of the window stands a woman wearing a red dress with a black corset.
She has horns on her head, black hair styled into a bun, and she's holding a
pink glass rapier in front of her face, looking down at it."""
