leaning backwards on her hands with one foot in the water. She's wearing a dark
blue one-piece swimsuit with a skirt, and she has teal and blue scales on her
shoulders and forearms. In the background is a night sky with two large
planets, reflected by the calm water."""

My standard art process: painting a cool background to distract from the fact
that I just felt like drawing a pretty lady.
