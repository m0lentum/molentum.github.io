I participated in [Art Fight] for the first time,
where I semi-accidentally ended up challenging myself
to make as many drawings as I can without ever repeating a style.
I've compiled my "attacks" and "defenses" on this page.
Big thanks to everyone involved for making such lovely art
and allowing me to post it!

One defense is still pending permission from the creator.
I'll update the page when they reply.

For the uninitiated, Art Fight is a game taking place over the month of July
where artists draw (or sculpt, or animate, or crochet, or ...) each other's characters.
Sending somebody an artwork is referred to as an "attack",
which generates points for your team,
and receiving an artwork is called a "defense".
So the "attacks" here are my drawings of other people's characters,
and "defenses" are others' drawings of my characters.
If you have an Art Fight account, you can also browse these on [my profile].

## Attacks

![Digital painting of a brick with a rabbit's face, limbs, and a hat resembling rabbit ears,
sitting on a bookshelf with an open book in front of it.](af_attack_box_bunny.jpg)
"Box bunny's book break" featuring Box Bunny for [DasMetalKitty] (character designed by [bestiaexmachina])

![Digital painting of a lady with bunny ears wearing a steampunk-style frilly dress
with a corset and leather adornments in earthy brown colors.
She's leaning on a brass railing with clouds behind and below.](af_attack_juritta.jpg)
"I don't know anything about ffxiv" featuring Juritta for [redstrate]

![Digital painting of Sciasm, an anthropomorphic animal of unknown species, at a metal show.
It's quite dark, only lit by the bright spotlights of the stage.
The painting style is very loose and impressionistic, leaving most details implied.](af_attack_sciasm.jpg)
"At a metal show" featuring Sciasm for [bestiaexmachina]

![Digital painting of an anthropomorphic dog lady wearing a slightly translucent dress
with lots of frills and layers. She's sitting on a chair in a garden with hedges and flowers.](af_attack_lois.jpg)
"I see a pretty dress, I draw it" featuring Lois for [fluffyfied]

![Digital painting of a woman watering flowers.
She's wearing a t-shirt, loose pants, and a brimmed hat.
The weather is overcast, with forest hills extending into the background.
Painted in a stylized way with everything made of polygons.](af_attack_myna.jpg)
"Watering the polygons" featuring Myna for [ZebraFeatherAH]

![Digital drawing of a woman with falcon wings landing on a grassy hill.
The pose is graceful and confident, looking effortless. Mountains and clouds are seen in the background.
Drawn in a style that resembes a pencil sketch on brown toned paper.](af_attack_kaleen.jpg)
"A smooth landing" featuring Kaleen Windstriker for [DaQueen]

![Digital painting of a woman in a blue dress walking through a starry void
along a bridge of light which she appears to be creating with her hands.
The light flows from a sun and moon behind her,
both of which have a clock-shaped magical glow around them.](af_attack_ura.jpg)
"Timeweaver" featuring Ura for [loude]

![Digital painting of a red-haired, freckled woman with a scar across her face.
Magical symbols swirl around the back of her head. She's dramatically lit,
wearing a black cloak in a dark space such that we can only see her face and hands.](af_attack_mabe.jpg)
"Just standing around being mysterious" featuring Mabe for [sillygobbo]

![Drawing of Aava, a merfolk marine biologist currently near the surface of the water.
She is wearing a dress that I would describe as a more saturated maroon color,
and her complexion is a light gray with diluted greens on her extremities.
She is poking the surface of the water, creating small ripples in it's wake.](af_defense_aava_redstrate.jpg)
