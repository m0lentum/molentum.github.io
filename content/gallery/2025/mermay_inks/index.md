![Colored ink drawing of Aava the mermaid relaxedly sitting on rocks at a lake shore with her tail dipped in the water.
The background is also painted in color; it's a calm, bright day
and you can see forest hills extending far into the distance.](mermay05.jpg)

![Colored ink drawing of Aava the mermaid underwater.
She's wearing a top with decorative streamers hanging off it, holding one of them in her hand.
The pose has a bit of sass to it, probably directed at the artist
who forgot to draw the streamers in the previous image.
The background is not colored, drawn in simple line that suggests underwater cliffs and seaweed.](mermay06.jpg)

There's seaweed and a school of fish in the background.
She's drawn in colored inks but using only lines, partially colored in with hatching.](mermay07.jpg)

![Ink drawing of a mermaid posing in front of a row of stone pillars.
She's again drawn with colored lines, but this time more of her is colored with hatching, not just the shaded parts.
This makes it a little hard to tell what's going on.](mermay08.jpg)
