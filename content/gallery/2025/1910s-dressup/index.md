wearing different floor-length evening dresses.
The first has a double-layered skirt, sleeves decorated with colorful thread and beads,
and a decorative sash hanging off the waist.
The second has short translucent sleeves, a sheer layer of decorative skirt,
and a long  hem that trails along the floor, made of cloth decorated with shiny embroidery.
The third is simpler in form, decorated with geometric patterns on the bust and hem."""

Some historical dresses from the 1910s
(found via [The Dreamstress](https://thedreamstress.com/category/rate-the-dress/);
original sources are various museums)
worn by [Miriel](/gallery/2024/miriel/) because why not.
Working my way out of a slump with some comfort zone portraits.
