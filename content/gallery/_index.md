Most, but not all, art here is licensed under CC0 (public domain).
Feel free to use my art for anything you like, 
but please make sure to check the license for each individual image.
Pages where all images are CC0 are also marked with a little corner badge.

Note: this gallery contains work featuring nudity and body horror.
I don't currently have a system to individually tag images with content warnings,
so keep an eye out if you're sensitive to such themes.
