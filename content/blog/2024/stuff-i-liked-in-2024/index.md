In recent years I've made a habit of posting
a list of my favorite heavy metal releases of the year on Mastodon.
This year I decided to list more than just music
and do it in a more permanent place here on my website.
So here are some books, games, and metal albums I enjoyed in 2024.

<!-- more -->

{% sidenote() %}
Only the metal albums are limited to releases that actually came out in 2024.
I don't spend enough time with other media to have anything left
if I were to impose such a limitation.

## Books

There was an entire decade where I barely read anything outside my studies,
but in 2023 I got back into reading in a big way.
This year I started reading fiction again too.
Here are some books I read and liked very much in 2024.

Shoutout to [Rob Haines](https://www.robhainescreative.space/writing/nonfiction/on-fiction/a-curated-selection-of-modern-speculative-fiction/)
for recommending me a bunch of excellent fiction.
{% end %}

### Nonfiction

**David Graeber & David Wengrow — The Dawn of Everything**<br>
A semi-speculative history of how past humans have organized their societies.
Eye-opening and politically inspiring.

**Jason Schreier — Press Reset: Ruin and Recovery in the Video Game Industry**<br>
A collection of stories about failure and adaptation in video game projects.
Sequel to Blood, Sweat, and Pixels, which is also a fun read
although with a less critical tone towards overwork.

**Robert Sapolsky — Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and Worst**<br>
A comprehensive look into the various processes governing human behavior,
and a strong argument against the existence of free will.

**Derek Yu — Spelunky**<br>
A short story about the design and development of _Spelunky_,
one of my favorite video games of all time.

### Fiction

**Ursula K. Le Guin — Annals of the Western Shore**<br>

**Seth Dickinson — The Traitor Baru Cormorant**<br>

**Adrian Tchaikovsky — City of Last Chances**<br>

**Becky Chambers — A Psalm for the Wild-Built**<br>

**Mary Robinette Kowal — The Calculating Stars**<br>

**Adrian Tchaikovsky — The Tiger and the Wolf**<br>


## Games

I don't play a lot of new games these days,
but I did play a few this year that I really enjoyed.
Perhaps making a list like this will motivate me to work through my backlog
and next year I'll have a longer list.
Since this is a new thing for me, though,
let me pad this list a little by adding the old favorites
that I continued to play throughout the year.

### 2024 releases

**UFO 50**<br>

**Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree**<br>

### older

**Beat Saber**<br>

**Spelunky 2**<br>

**Metal: Hellsinger**<br>

**N++: Community Tab Project**<br>
