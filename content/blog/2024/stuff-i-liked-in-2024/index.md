In recent years I've made a habit of posting
a list of my favorite heavy metal releases of the year on Mastodon.
This year I decided to list more than just music
and do it in a more permanent place here on my website.
So here are some metal albums, books, and games I enjoyed in 2024.

<!-- more -->

{% sidenote() %}
Only the metal albums are limited to releases that actually came out in 2024.
I don't spend enough time with other media to have anything left
if I were to impose such a limitation.
{% end %}


## Heavy metal

My top 5 releases of the year in ranked order:

**1. Disembodied Tyrant / Synestia — The Poetic Edda**<br>
Impeccably produced high-intensity symphonic deathcore;
technical, melodic, and inventive.
Features possibly first breakdown I've ever liked.

**2. Seven Spires — A Fortress Called Home**<br>
Every member of this band is a master of their craft,
and the variety of influences they blend with their symphonic metal core
is equal parts fun and impressive.

**3. IOTUNN — Kinship**<br>
An entire hour of progressive metal with a massive, ostentatious sound
and a grand sense of adventure.

**4. Ankor — Shoganai**<br>
Well-crafted metalcore with plenty of catchy melodies and emotional intensity,
plus some clever bits of electronic dance music weaved throughout.

**5. Enterprise Earth — Death: An Anthology**<br>
A novel blend of deathcore, thrash, and various other influences,
including the best pop chorus of the year in _Blood and Teeth_.

And then a whole bunch more that I liked in no particular order.
There are way too many to describe all of them,
but I'll include subgenres to give an idea of what to expect.

- **Wintersun — Time II** (symphonic prog/melodeath)
- **Andy Gillion — Exilium** (melodeath)
- **A Wake In Providence — I Write To You, My Darling Decay** (symphonic blackened deathcore)
- **Fleshgod Apocalypse — Opera** (symphonic death)
- **Assemble the Chariots — Unyielding Night** (symphonic prog/death)
- **Scarlet Meridian — A Modern Noir** (prog/metalcore)
- **Allt — From The New World** (prog/metalcore)
- **Orden Ogan — The Order Of Fear** (power)
- **HIZAKI — The Zodiac Sign** (neoclassical)
- **Cyborg Octopus — Bottom Feeder** (prog)
- **Nightwish — Yesterwynde** (symphonic)
- **Evergrey — Theories of Emptiness** (prog/power)
- **Dååth — The Deceivers** (prog/death)
- **Ad Infinitum — Abyss** (symphonic)
- **Entheos — An End To Everything** (prog/death)
- **Fit For An Autopsy — The Nothing That Is** (death)
- **Blood Incantation — Absolute Elsewhere** (prog/death)
- **Opeth — The Last Will And Testament** (prog/death)
- **Brothers of Metal — Fimbulvinter** (power/folk)
- **SETYØURSAILS — Bad Blood** (metalcore)


## Books

In 2023 I got back into reading for fun
after a lengthy period of only reading to study.
This year I started reading fiction again too.
Here are some books I read and enjoyed in 2024.

Shoutout to [Rob Haines](https://www.robhainescreative.space/writing/nonfiction/on-fiction/a-curated-selection-of-modern-speculative-fiction/)
for recommending me most of the fiction listed here.
{% end %}

### Nonfiction

**David Graeber & David Wengrow — The Dawn of Everything**<br>
A semi-speculative history of how past humans have organized their societies.
Eye-opening and politically inspiring.

**Jason Schreier — Press Reset: Ruin and Recovery in the Video Game Industry**<br>
A collection of stories about failure and adaptation in video game projects.
Follows after _Blood, Sweat, and Pixels_, which is also a fun read
although with a less coherent message.

**Robert Sapolsky — Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and Worst**<br>
A comprehensive look into the various processes governing human behavior,
and a strong argument against the existence of free will.

**Derek Yu — Spelunky**<br>
A short story about the design and development of _Spelunky_,
one of my favorite video games of all time.

### Fiction

**Ursula K. Le Guin — Annals of the Western Shore**<br>
Three stories about small people in a large, richly detailed low-fantasy world.
Full of interesting politics and grounded, complex characters.
My favorite of a few different Le Guin books I read this year.

**Seth Dickinson — The Traitor Baru Cormorant**<br>
Another low-fantasy tale full of political intrigue and complex worldbuilding,
but with a more modern tone than Le Guin's work.
A girl sets out to climb the ranks of the imperialist nation
that assimilated her home in an attempt to destroy it from within.

**Adrian Tchaikovsky — City of Last Chances**<br>
I'm a sucker for fantasy worlds with complicated politics
and explainable magic systems.
Here's the third one of those in this list.
Various strange gods and magical traditions
meet a power-hungry empire with world war 1 -era weaponry.

**Becky Chambers — A Psalm for the Wild-Built**<br>
A beautiful, comforting solarpunk world
where humanity's problems are smaller and stakes lower.
Nothing particularly deep, but sometimes a pleasant utopia to relax in
is just what you need.

**Mary Robinette Kowal — The Calculating Stars**<br>
An alternative history of the space race
told from the perspective of a woman
whose participation faces all the gender-based obstacles
one might expect from the time period.
Interesting character drama and a well-considered plot
taking lots of inspiration from real-life events,
culminating (in later books in the series)
in some fascinating space-travel stories.

**Adrian Tchaikovsky — The Tiger and the Wolf**<br>
Back to fantasy - this one takes place in an ancient Nordic-inspired land,
lonely and desolate in a way that feels a little like home to me as a Finn.
People have animal spirits which dictate their ways of life,
but a girl is born with more than one of them,
which puts her at odds with her tribe
and forces her to forge her own path through the world.

**Amal El-Mohtar & Max Gladstone — This is How You Lose the Time War**<br>



## Games

I don't play a lot of new games these days,
but I did play a few this year that I really enjoyed.
Perhaps making a list like this will motivate me to work through my backlog
and next year I'll have a longer list.
Since this is a new thing for me, though,
let me pad this list a little by adding the old favorites
that I continued to play throughout the year.

### 2024 releases

**UFO 50**<br>

**Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree**<br>

**Mouthwashing**<br>

### older

**Beat Saber**<br>

**Spelunky 2**<br>

**N++: Community Tab Project**<br>
