The oldest digital drawing I have on my computer turns ten years old today.
This post is a self-indulgent trip down memory lane,
looking back at landmark pieces and lessons learned throughout the years.

## 2015

I was 18 years old.
I'd never done much drawing aside from a brief period in middle school
where I wanted to draw Donald Duck comics.
Now I had decided I want to learn to draw so I can make graphics for games.
The very first thing I made was a pixel art mole for a profile picture,
one that I kept using for quite a few years:

{{ fit_img(width=800, height=800,
alt="Low-resolution pixel art of a mole peeking out of the ground."
src="/blog/2025/decade-of-digital-art/pixel_mole.png"
)}}

The nice thing about low-resolution pixel art like this
is that you can kind of brute-force it
by swapping pixels around until it looks alright,
but I wanted to really learn to draw.
So I bought a tablet, downloaded GnuIMP, and started scribbling some awful fanart
of one of Vi's silly outfits from Wings of Vi
(a fun precision platformer I was speedrunning at the time).

{{ fit_img(width=800, height=800,
alt="Digital drawing of a gray-skinned woman with wings wearing silly leotard-shaped gold armor."
src="/blog/2025/decade-of-digital-art/2015-vi.jpg"
)}}

I didn't manage to do much beyond this before I was conscripted for military service
(as every Finnish man of the age is)
and dropped the hobby for the rest of the year.


## 2016

My military service ended slightly prematurely with a testicular cancer diagnosis.
In the summer while I was (successfully) undergoing chemotherapy,
I started trying to make drawings again.
I learned about basic construction of the human body,
took some clumsy attempts at exercising it,

{{ fit_img(width=800, height=800,
alt="A grid of wonky heads with basic construction lines."
src="/blog/2025/decade-of-digital-art/2016-head-practice.jpg"
)}}

and painted this Christmas greeting card,
which would later become quite a long-lasting tradition.

{{ fit_img(width=800, height=800,
alt="Digital painting of a mole peeking out of a pile of wrapped presents."
src="/blog/2025/decade-of-digital-art/2016-christmas-card.jpg"
)}}

I also made some "mole" emotes for Discord,
which went on to become surprisingly popular
in certain communities
(shoutout to the I Wanna Be the Guy and N++ folks,
many of whom I'm still friends with to this day).

Some deep lore about the mole character:
the thing on its head is a green beret,
in reference to my username at the time "MoleTrooper"
and my recent service in the Finnish military.
{% end %}


## 2017

Up until the end of October 2017 I was only drawing sporadically
and making very little progress.
That was the point where I decided to really take this hobby seriously
and make a habit of drawing something every day.
I bought a big sketchbook and filled its 160 pages by the end of the year,
mostly with figure drawings and study sketches of art I liked.
I also tried a bit of digital painting,
including this self-portrait

{{ fit_img(width=800, height=800,
alt="Digital painting of me raising an eyebrow."
src="/blog/2025/decade-of-digital-art/2017-self-portrait.jpg"
)}}

and another, much more successful greeting card.

{{ fit_img(width=800, height=800,
alt="Digital painting of a spruce tree with a ball of light at its top
in a snowy forest at night."
src="/blog/2025/decade-of-digital-art/2017-christmas-card.jpg"
)}}


## 2018

I continued to do a lot of sketchbook figure drawing,
and it was starting to pay off a little —
my drawings were starting to get more accurate
with a basic sense of perspective and structure.

{{ fit_img(width=800, height=800,
alt="Digital painting of a harpy wearing a dress."
src="/blog/2025/decade-of-digital-art/2018-harpy.jpg"
)}}

This self-portrait was so good for the time
I've even [featured it](/gallery/2018/self-portrait-2018/) in the gallery section on this website.

{{ fit_img(width=800, height=800,
alt="A digital painting of a brown-haired young man in a green
flannel shirt looking to the side with a pondering expression."
src="/gallery/2018/self_portrait_2018/self_portrait_2018.jpg"
)}}


## 2019

I didn't do much digital art in 2019.
I don't entirely remember why,
but I suspect I was just mostly preoccupied with programming.
I only have two finished works from this year,
plus a few unfinished project files I have no memory of and no easy access to
(because I was using Clip Studio Paint at the time,
which doesn't run on my current Linux setup).

This was a submission for the graphic art compo at local demoparty Instanssi,
made by drawing over a nonogram from a puzzle magazine,
and surprisingly won third place.

{{ fit_img(width=800, height=800,
alt="Digital painting of a chameleon sitting amongst some very green leaves."
src="/blog/2025/decade-of-digital-art/2019-chameleonogram.jpg"
)}}

This one was my first artwork for Mermay,
a social media event I've since participated in every year.

{{ fit_img(width=800, height=800,
alt="Digital painting of mermaid playing a game of solitaire on a rock on the seafloor."
src="/blog/2025/decade-of-digital-art/2019-mermay.jpg"
)}}


## 2020

Another somewhat slow year, but with some big highlights.
At this point we're reaching work I still like enough of to keep in the [gallery](/gallery/).

[This Mermay piece](/gallery/2020/youre-not-afraid-of-the-dark-are-you/)
was a huge step up in my lineart skills
and semi-accidentally also pretty nicely composed and painted.

{{ fit_img(width=800, height=800,
alt="Digital painting of a mermaid with a green tail large orange fins, and orange hair.
She heads towards a dark cave, looking back at the viewer with an amused expression."
src="/gallery/2020/youre_not_afraid_of_the_dark_are_you/merm.jpg"
)}}

I also made another attempt at a [self-portrait](/gallery/2020/self-portrait-2020/),
which again stepped up my painting skills.
This one finally replaced my mole profile picture from 2015
and also introduced Very Thick Outlines,
a style feature I then proceeded to take a little too far.

{{ fit_img(width=800, height=800,
alt="A digital painting of a young man with pale skin and dark brown hair dyed green on top,
sitting on a stone pillar playing a 7-string Cort KX500MS electric guitar."
src="/gallery/2020/self_portrait_2020/self_portrait_2020.jpg"
)}}


## 2021

In 2021 I did a lot of exploration with more stylized ways of drawing,
such as this experiment in a flat style for video game purposes inspired by
[The King's Bird](https://store.steampowered.com/app/812550/The_Kings_Bird/),

{{ fit_img(width=800, height=800,
alt="Digital drawing of an arc-shaped bridge crossing a small river.
There are trees and a windmill in the background. Stylized shapes with entirely flat colors."
src="/blog/2025/decade-of-digital-art/2021-bridge.jpg"
)}}

and this [tree](/gallery/2021/a-cool-tree/), which felt like a breakthrough of sorts at the time,
although I later realized I hadn't actually learned as much from it
as I thought I had.

{{ fit_img(width=800, height=800,
alt="A digital drawing of a leafy tree standing on a steep slope in warm orange sunlight.
Its leaves are in the process of changing color, with red on top, yellow in the middle, and green at the bottom.
Behind it are some rolling hills and the dark clouds of an oncoming thunderstorm."
src="/gallery/2021/a_cool_tree/a_cool_tree.jpg"
)}}


## 2022

Now we're getting to some really productive years.
In January I made [this fanart of Isidora from Blasphemous](/gallery/2022/isidora/),
where I was very proud of the level of detail and subtle perspective.

{{ fit_img(width=800, height=800,
alt="Digital painting depicting Isidora, Voice of the Dead from the game Blasphemous.
She's floating in the air with her cape billowing behind her,
singing with her eyes closed, while fireballs circle around her in the background."
src="/gallery/2022/isidora/isidora.jpg"
)}}

I then stepped up the level of detail even further with [this Elden Ring fanart piece](/gallery/2022/nox-dragonslayer/).

{{ fit_img(width=800, height=800,
alt="A digital drawing of a green-haired woman wearing ornate leather armor with a white cloth cape.
She's carrying a large corkscrew-shaped sword over her shoulder, and a magic staff in the other hand.
She's standing confidently in front of a slain two-headed dragon."
src="/gallery/2022/nox_dragonslayer/nox_dragonslayer.jpg"
)}}

However, the real revelation came when I joined a Discord community called Art Corner
where I asked for feedback on my work for the first time.
The responses from the wonderful folks there taught me
that I didn't understand the role of value in lighting and composition at all,
and resulted in [this piece](/gallery/2022/poppy/) which is still one of my favorites.

{{ fit_img(width=800, height=800,
alt="A digital painting featuring a large and brightly lit stained glass window depicting red poppy flowers.
In front of the window stands a woman wearing a red and black dress.
She has horns on her head, black hair styled into a bun,
and she's holding a pink glass rapier in front of her face."
src="/gallery/2022/poppy/poppy.jpg"
)}}

Remember in 2017 when I started drawing every day?
I was still doing it in 2022,
but at the end of the year I finally gave up the habit
after a little over five years without missing a day.
I believe that habit was crucial in carrying me past the struggles of early learning
and into a stage where drawing is consistently fun and rewarding.


## 2023

With so many works I still like, there's a temptation to make this post very long,
but I'll keep it to a few highlights.

[This one](/gallery/2023/canopy/) pushed the scale of my environments further than ever
and has a certain peaceful yet grand mood that influenced my later work in a big way.
The character didn't have a deeper story at the time but later turned into a prototypical [Miriel](/gallery/2024/miriel/).

{{ fit_img(width=800, height=800,
alt="Digital drawing of a foggy forest at sunset, viewed from the top branches of a tall tree.

src="/gallery/2023/canopy/break_in_the_canopy.jpg"
)}}

[This Diablo IV fanart piece](/gallery/2023/wandering-sharpshooter/) was
an extremely successful attempt at a completely different style,
and a first step in a more coarsely textured direction.

{{ fit_img(width=800, height=800,
alt="Digital drawing of a green-haired woman standing on a muddy road in the snowy wilderness of Fractured Peaks.
She's wearing light leather and plate armor with a green cloth hood,
and carries a crossbow, two swords, and several small daggers."
src="/gallery/2023/wandering_sharpshooter/sharpshooter.jpg"
)}}

Finally, I participated in [Inktober](/gallery/2023/inktober-2023/)
for the first time and discovered a love for ink which really blossomed in 2024.

{{ fit_img(width=800, height=800,
alt="Ink drawing of a Toad (the character from Super Mario) riding a toad (the animal from real life)
and holding up a little sword."
src="/gallery/2023/inktober_2023/08_toad.jpg"
)}}


## 2024

By far my most prolific year hitherto recorded.
I made [fifty](/gallery/2024/mermay-inks/) [ink](/gallery/2024/inktober-2024/) [drawings](/gallery/2024/blooming/),
incorporated [demoscene-style](/gallery/2024/demodemonini/)
[computer graphics](/gallery/2024/moonstaff/) into my work,
started a worldbuilding project where I designed some of my first
[real](/gallery/2024/miriel/) [characters](/gallery/2024/ivu/)
with actual backstories,
[experimented](/gallery/2024/of-the-soil/) with style,
and spent a lot of time studying landscapes, [color](/gallery/2024/sunsetswim/) and [light](/gallery/2024/shmallow/).

{{ fit_img(width=800, height=800,
alt="Digital painting depicting a quiet lake at sunset.

its light filtering through the top branches and reflecting from the clouds above.

)}}

{{ fit_img(width=800, height=800,
alt="Digital painting of a woman with birch bark for skin and leaves for hair standing in a moonlit meadow.

)}}

{{ fit_img(width=800, height=800,
alt="Ink drawing of a woman in a loose dress walking in a forest with her arms spread to the sides.

)}}


## 2025

And that brings us to present day!
I'm quite proud of my progress,
happy I discovered this hobby and pushed through the hard times,
and looking forward to the next decade of making and learning.

I mostly wrote this post for my own enjoyment,
but I hope it might serve as a reminder that what people call "talent"
is actually just being very interested in a thing and doing a lot of work.
Anybody can learn to draw, it just takes years of effort
(good learning methods and teachers are a must though —
years of aimless scribbling will just make you good at aimless scribbling).
There's tons of free education about art fundamentals available on the internet.
Give it a try if you're interested at all!
Learning to draw is quite possibly the most rewarding thing I've done in my entire life
and I hope more people get to experience it.
