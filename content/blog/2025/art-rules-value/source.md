## Atmospheric perspective

Atmospheric perspective is the idea that things far away
have less color contrast and saturation than things up close
(where the word "perspective" means that it's a way to communicate how far something is,
unrelated to the geometric perspective constructions we'll look at later).
This follows from the fact that air is never fully transparent —
it has a color with some small amount of opacity.
Often this is a fog-like neutral white created by water vapor
or a blue created by scattering in the same way the blue sky is,
but can be anything for situational and artistic purposes),
and the more air there is between a thing and the viewer,
the more we see of this color.
Since everything gets blended towards the same air color,
this always has the overall effect of reducing contrast.


## Light source dominates value and color

If your primary light source is visible in frame,
it's always going to be the brightest part of the image by value.
This is because the rest of what we see is (at least mostly)
light originating from this source
that has been reflected off an object.
Whenever a reflection occurs, some energy is absorbed,
causing our eyes to perceive less brightness.

Relatedly, the color of the primary light source (whether in or out of frame)
has a much stronger influence on colors seen than local color.
This is, again, because reflections can only absorb colors out of the light,
never (outside of unusual phenomena like fluorescence) add new colors to it.

TODO: talk a bit about spectra

{% sidenote() %}
Local color is what we think about as the "inherent" color of a thing,
but there's no color without light —
this is really the color seen under some reference white light.
{% end %}

This is a simple idea, but it can be unintuitive and difficult to apply at first,
since we tend to think in terms of local color first and then apply light to it.
Thinking this way works fine when the light is nearly white,
but with strongly colored lights it pays to flip the thought process on its head:
the light color comes first, and local color only transforms it.


## Groupings of values

Why are values grouped like that,
with the terminator line so clear and midtones narrow
(cosine rule, microfacet theory)


## Gradients on the color wheel

Shadow gradients are usually simple curves on the color wheel


## Warm light, cool shadows


## Details are in the midtones


## Saturated shadow edges

Two reasons: subsurface scattering,
(what's that other phenomenon called, I'm pretty sure I saw it in a Marco Bucci video)
