Mikael Myyrä, perhaps more often known by his online
alias MoleTrooper, is a professional programmer, university student majoring in
computer science, and general nerdlord from Jyväskylä, Finland. He has
unreasonably high ambitions in all areas of his life, especially his hobbies.
These include game development, graphic art, guitar, disc golf, and going very
fast in video games, among others. As of fall 2020 he is studying for his
master's degree specializing in simulations at the University of Jyväskylä,
while also working part-time as a fullstack web developer at the same
university's Digital Services, and still somehow finding time to write
exhaustingly long run-on sentences about himself in third person on his website
in a (likely doomed) attempt to sound just pretentious enough to come across as
competent and respectable but not so much as to be offputtingly pompous.

When it comes to coding for fun, Mole's passions lie in
geometry and movement. In other words, if it involves vectors and matrices,
he's probably interested. If it makes pictures appear on a screen, he's
already hooked. His pet project and the primary subject of his blog is
[Starframe](https://github.com/MoleTrooper/starframe), a 2D
game engine with a focus on side-scrolling physics. He has strong opinions on
game design and considers himself an expert on platformers.

For those interested in a hodgepodge of project updates, art, game
recommendations, and miscellaneous garbage,
