          <title>Art rules from first principles, part 1: Perspective</title>

          <description xml:base="https://molentum.me/blog/2025/art-rules-perspective/">&lt;p&gt;There are many shorthands and rules of thumb
one encounters when learning the fundamentals of representational art —
vanishing points, warm-cool contrasts,
grouping of values into light, midtone and shadow, etc.
There are many good non-technical explanations of these ideas out there,
but I wanted to dive deeper
and investigate how they arise from the physics of light
and geometry of space.
In this first part we&#x27;ll look at geometric interpretations
of common perspective drawing methods.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;</description></item>

          <description xml:base="https://molentum.me/blog/2025/krita-tips/">&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;m a big fan of using software effectively and optimizing my workflows,
so over my years using &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;krita.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Krita&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; I&#x27;ve spent quite a bit of time digging into its features.
In this post I want to talk about how I use this wonderful piece of software
and highlight some not-so-obvious bits
that have made a difference in my process.
I&#x27;ll do general painting first, hopefully in a way that is useful to beginners,
and then indulge in some nerding out about normal maps and how to make them.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;</description></item>

This post is a self-indulgent trip down memory lane,
looking back at landmark pieces and lessons learned throughout the years.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;</description></item>

          <title>Game graphics: the journey so far</title>
          <pubDate>Sun, 19 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

          <description xml:base="https://molentum.me/blog/2025/game-graphics/">&lt;p&gt;The majority of my recent game development work
has revolved around graphics —
both workflows for making them
and technology for rendering them.
Many ideas have been had and many scrapped along the way,
and the journey certainly isn&#x27;t over yet,
but I think I&#x27;m moving towards something pretty unique and cool.
This is a devlog-style post where I meander through
some of the more noteworthy moments so far
without going very deep into technical details
(but providing technical sources where relevant).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;</description></item>

          <title>Rounding collider corners</title>

          <description xml:base="https://molentum.me/blog/2025/rounding-collider-corners/">&lt;p&gt;Back in 2022 I entirely rewrote one of the most complicated parts of &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;m0lentum&#x2F;starframe&quot;&gt;Starframe&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
the collision detection system.
A notable feature of the new system is the ability to give any shape rounded corners.
I also wrote most of this post back then, but things happened and it was left unfinished.
Here it is now, more than two years later.
Better late than never I suppose.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;</description></item>

          <description xml:base="https://molentum.me/blog/2024/stuff-i-liked-in-2024/">&lt;p&gt;In recent years I&#x27;ve made a habit of posting
a list of my favorite heavy metal releases of the year on Mastodon.
This year I decided to list more than just music
and do it in a more permanent place here on my website.
So here are some metal albums, books, and games I enjoyed in 2024.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;</description></item>

          <description xml:base="https://molentum.me/blog/2024/ten-formative-games/">&lt;p&gt;Inspired by recent discussions in the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;eggplant.show&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Eggplant Show&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; Discord community,
here&#x27;s a list of ten video games.
Not my favorite games (though many of them are that too),
but ones that had a notable influence on who I am today.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;</description></item>

understanding of the problem and knowledge of available methods have grown. In
this post I attempt to explain what constraints are and detail a few
game-engine-friendly ways of solving them. I&#x27;ll try to make this
understandable to someone with approximately the level of knowledge I had
before starting this: decent linear algebra and calculus skills and a
tiny bit of physics knowledge.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;</description></item>

          <description xml:base="https://molentum.me/blog/2020/starframe-architecture/">&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ve spent a large portion of the past two years writing and rewriting
the basic structures that describe a game and its content in &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;m0lentum&#x2F;starframe&quot;&gt;Starframe&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (formerly known as MoleEngine).
These are some notes on what I&#x27;ve done so far and what I&#x27;ve learned from it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;</description></item>

          <description xml:base="https://molentum.me/blog/2018/starframe-intro/">&lt;p&gt;Starframe is an ambitious hobby project, still early on in development, aiming to create a general-purpose 2D
game engine suitable for rapid prototyping and game jams as well as more polished, hopefully commercial-quality products.
This blog is meant to document the development and ideas behind it in a fair bit of detail - mostly to organize and
revise my own thoughts, but with the hope that someone else might also find it interesting and&#x2F;or helpful.
In this first post I will outline what exactly I am trying to accomplish and why I am doing it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;</description></item>
