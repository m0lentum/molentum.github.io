        <p>In recent years I've made a habit of posting
a list of my favorite heavy metal releases of the year on Mastodon.
This year I decided to list more than just music
and do it in a more permanent place here on my website.
So here are some metal albums, books, and games I enjoyed in 2024.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span><div class="sidenote">
    <p>Only the metal albums are limited to releases that actually came out in 2024.
I don't spend enough time with other media to have anything left
if I were to impose such a limitation.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="heavy-metal">Heavy metal<a class="zola-anchor" href="#heavy-metal" aria-label="Anchor link for: heavy-metal">§</a>
</h2>
<p>My top 5 releases of the year in ranked order:</p>
<p><strong>1. Disembodied Tyrant / Synestia — The Poetic Edda</strong><br>
Impeccably produced high-intensity symphonic deathcore;
technical, melodic, and inventive.
Features possibly first breakdown I've ever liked.</p>
<p><strong>2. IOTUNN — Kinship</strong><br>
An entire hour of beautiful progressive metal
with a massive, ostentatious sound and a grand sense of adventure.</p>
<p><strong>3. Seven Spires — A Fortress Called Home</strong><br>
Every member of this band is a master of their craft,
and the variety of influences they blend with their symphonic metal core
is equal parts fun and impressive.</p>
<p><strong>4. Ankor — Shoganai</strong><br>
Well-crafted metalcore with plenty of catchy melodies and emotional intensity,
plus some clever bits of electronic dance music weaved throughout.</p>
<p><strong>5. Enterprise Earth — Death: An Anthology</strong><br>
A novel blend of deathcore, thrash, and various other influences,
including the best pop chorus of the year in <em>Blood and Teeth</em>.</p>
<p>And then a whole bunch more that I liked in no particular order.
There are too many to describe all of them,
but I'll include subgenres to give an idea of what to expect.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wintersun — Time II</strong> (symphonic prog/melodeath)</li>
<li><strong>Andy Gillion — Exilium</strong> (melodeath)</li>
<li><strong>A Wake In Providence — I Write To You, My Darling Decay</strong> (symphonic blackened deathcore)</li>
<li><strong>Fleshgod Apocalypse — Opera</strong> (symphonic death)</li>
<li><strong>Assemble the Chariots — Unyielding Night</strong> (symphonic prog/death)</li>
<li><strong>Scarlet Meridian — A Modern Noir</strong> (prog/metalcore)</li>
<li><strong>Allt — From The New World</strong> (prog/metalcore)</li>
<li><strong>Orden Ogan — The Order Of Fear</strong> (power)</li>
<li><strong>HIZAKI — The Zodiac Sign</strong> (neoclassical)</li>
<li><strong>Cyborg Octopus — Bottom Feeder</strong> (prog)</li>
<li><strong>Nightwish — Yesterwynde</strong> (symphonic)</li>
<li><strong>Evergrey — Theories of Emptiness</strong> (prog/power)</li>
<li><strong>Dååth — The Deceivers</strong> (prog/death)</li>
<li><strong>Ad Infinitum — Abyss</strong> (symphonic)</li>
<li><strong>Entheos — An End To Everything</strong> (prog/death)</li>
<li><strong>Fit For An Autopsy — The Nothing That Is</strong> (death)</li>
<li><strong>Blood Incantation — Absolute Elsewhere</strong> (prog/death)</li>
<li><strong>Opeth — The Last Will And Testament</strong> (prog/death)</li>
<li><strong>Brothers of Metal — Fimbulvinter</strong> (power/folk)</li>
<li><strong>SETYØURSAILS — Bad Blood</strong> (metalcore)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="books">Books<a class="zola-anchor" href="#books" aria-label="Anchor link for: books">§</a>
</h2>
<p>In 2023 I got back into reading for fun
after a lengthy period of only reading to study.
This year I started reading fiction again too.
Here are some books I read and enjoyed in 2024.</p>
<div class="sidenote">
    <p>Big thanks to <a href="https://www.robhainescreative.space/writing/nonfiction/on-fiction/a-curated-selection-of-modern-speculative-fiction/">Rob Haines</a>
for recommending me most of the fiction listed here.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="nonfiction">Nonfiction<a class="zola-anchor" href="#nonfiction" aria-label="Anchor link for: nonfiction">§</a>
</h3>
<p><strong>David Graeber &amp; David Wengrow — The Dawn of Everything</strong><br>
A semi-speculative history of how past humans have organized their societies
based on anthropological and archaeological evidence.
Eye-opening and politically inspiring.</p>
<p><strong>Jason Schreier — Press Reset: Ruin and Recovery in the Video Game Industry</strong><br>
A collection of stories about failure and adaptation in video game projects.
Follows after <em>Blood, Sweat, and Pixels</em>, which is also a fun read
although with a less coherent message.</p>
<p><strong>Robert Sapolsky — Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and Worst</strong><br>
A comprehensive look into the various processes governing human behavior,
and a strong argument against the existence of free will.</p>
<p><strong>Derek Yu — Spelunky</strong><br>
A short story about the design and development of <em>Spelunky</em>,
one of my favorite video games of all time.</p>
<h3 id="fiction">Fiction<a class="zola-anchor" href="#fiction" aria-label="Anchor link for: fiction">§</a>
</h3>
<p><strong>Ursula K. Le Guin — Annals of the Western Shore</strong><br>
Three stories about small people in a large, richly detailed low-fantasy world.
Full of interesting politics and grounded, complex characters.
My favorite of a few different Le Guin books I read this year.</p>
<p><strong>Seth Dickinson — The Traitor Baru Cormorant</strong><br>
Another low-fantasy tale full of political intrigue and complex worldbuilding,
but with a more modern tone than Le Guin's work.
A girl sets out to climb the ranks of the imperialist nation
that assimilated her home in an attempt to destroy it from within.</p>
<p><strong>Adrian Tchaikovsky — City of Last Chances</strong><br>
I'm a sucker for fantasy worlds with complicated politics
and explainable magic systems.
Here's the third one of those in this list.
Various strange gods and magical traditions
meet a power-hungry empire with world war 1 -era weaponry.</p>
<p><strong>Becky Chambers — A Psalm for the Wild-Built</strong><br>
A beautiful, comforting solarpunk world
where humanity's problems are smaller and stakes lower.
Nothing particularly deep, but sometimes a pleasant utopia to relax in
is just what you need.</p>
<p><strong>Mary Robinette Kowal — The Calculating Stars</strong><br>
An alternative history of the space race
told from the perspective of a woman
whose participation faces all the gender-based obstacles
one might expect from the time period.
Interesting character drama and a well-considered plot
taking lots of inspiration from real-life events,
culminating (in later books in the series)
in some fascinating space-travel stories.</p>
<p><strong>Adrian Tchaikovsky — The Tiger and the Wolf</strong><br>
Back to fantasy - this one takes place in an ancient Nordic-inspired land,
lonely and desolate in a way that feels a little like home to me as a Finn.
People have animal spirits which dictate their ways of life,
but a girl is born with more than one of them,
which puts her at odds with her tribe
and forces her to forge her own path through the world.</p>
<p><strong>Amal El-Mohtar &amp; Max Gladstone — This is How You Lose the Time War</strong><br>
A convoluted time-travel story taking place over unimaginable lengths of time on the one hand,
an impressively written piece of love poetry on the other.
I've never read anything else like it.</p>
<h2 id="games">Games<a class="zola-anchor" href="#games" aria-label="Anchor link for: games">§</a>
</h2>
<p>I don't play a lot of new games these days,
but I did play a few this year that I really enjoyed.
Perhaps making a list like this will motivate me to work through my backlog
and next year I'll have a longer list.
Since this is a new thing for me, though,
let me pad this list a little by adding the old favorites
that I continued to play throughout the year.</p>
<h3 id="2024-releases">2024 releases<a class="zola-anchor" href="#2024-releases" aria-label="Anchor link for: 2024-releases">§</a>
</h3>
<p><strong>UFO 50</strong><br>
A collection of 50 games designed for a fictional NES-style console,
each with something interesting to say and enough substance to feel like a real game.
An absolute box of delights for anyone
who likes learning to play a game and engaging with its design.</p>
<div class="sidenote">
    <p>Shoutout to the <a href="https://eggplant.show/">Eggplant Show</a>
and their weekly "bookclub" podcast about the game,
which has made engaging with it that much more fun.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</strong><br>
An excellent distillation of the already amazing world of Elden Ring
into a more compact, intense, and satisfying package.</p>
<p><strong>Mouthwashing</strong><br>
A short surreal horror story about the crew of a crashed spaceship.
Disturbing in a thought-provoking kind of way,
dealing with themes of disability, dependency and betrayal.</p>
<h3 id="older">older<a class="zola-anchor" href="#older" aria-label="Anchor link for: older">§</a>
</h3>
<p><strong>Beat Saber</strong><br>
I've been playing this game nonstop since it came out in 2018
and I'm still not even a little bit bored of it.
A simple idea simply executed, but so expressive and fun,
and made infinitely replayable by the creative and competitive modding community.
Plus, it's good physical exercise too.</p>
<p><strong>Spelunky 2</strong><br>
I consider <em>Spelunky</em> the most beautifully designed game of all time.
The sequel is not quite as elegant,
but I find it even more fun to replay
thanks to its branching paths and the endurance challenge of the Cosmic Ocean.
I spent a lot of time playing the daily challenge this year,
and to brag a little, beat 7-99 quite a few times,
ending up in first place on the challenge leaderboard twice.</p>
<p><strong>N++: Community Tab Project</strong><br>
A massive mod that replaces the entire original collection of levels
in N++ (the best platformer of all time) with community-made ones.
Very polished with tons of variety,
including obscure mechanics and glitches
that the base game understandably never foregrounds.
It has made N++ feel fresh and new again.</p>
<div class="sidenote">
    <p>You can find installation instructions for this and many other mods
in <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3396684470">this Steam community guide</a>.
Also, here's the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aotfrD757U">trailer on YouTube</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="sidenote">
    <p>I should also mention
I've been streaming my progress with the mod on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/molentum">Twitch</a>
on Sunday evenings.
I'm probably still playing it if you're reading this in early 2025.
Come say hi in chat if that sounds fun.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="personal-achievements">Personal achievements<a class="zola-anchor" href="#personal-achievements" aria-label="Anchor link for: personal-achievements">§</a>
</h2>
<p>Now that I've highlighted a bunch of other people's work,
let me also indulge in a little retrospection on my own year.
2024 has been great for me overall,
not without its struggles but with many successes, including</p>
<ul>
<li>completed my master's degree and got a new job as a doctoral researcher,
which I've loved so far</li>
<li>made 50 ink drawings, gaining tons of confidence with the medium,
and many digital paintings I'm proud of</li>
<li>did some cool graphics programming (blog post about that coming later, hopefully)
and published <a href="https://molentum.itch.io/velgi">my first game on itch.io</a></li>
<li>learned to sew and made some actually wearable and good-looking clothes</li>
<li>came out of my shell a little bit and participated in some social events</li>
</ul>
<p>Good times. I'll refrain from making any promises for 2025,
but I look forward to continuing to improve myself and do creative work.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading; I hope you found something to like in the lists.
May the upcoming year treat you well.</p>
